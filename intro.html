            <p>Hello,

                I am Nduke Khadija Nyamvula, a dynamic and accomplished Information Technology professional with a Bachelor's degree from South Eastern Kenya University. A Kenyan national, born on July 3, 1993, I bring over five years of experience in system design, implementation, and project management.
                
                My academic journey includes a comprehensive education in Information Technology, further solidified by practical training, workshops, and certifications, such as IBM Data Science and IT Fundamentals. My proficiency extends beyond technical skills, encompassing ISO 9001:2015 standard, data science, security awareness, and website management.
                
                In my most recent role as a Senior ICT Officer at the Ministry of Education, Nairobi, I have been instrumental in driving successful projects, such as the implementation of the JITUME program in TVET institutions.The program's primary objective is to distribute 23,000 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) devices to Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions across Kenya.  I have served as a key figure in the administration of TVETMIS and TVET Tracer systems, showcasing my expertise as a System Administrator and Designer.
                
                My achievements speak to my commitment to quality assurance and project implementation, evident in the enhancement of TVET systems, upgrading of QMS documents, and the development of critical ICT policies. With a strong analytical foundation, I have consistently provided customized reports based on data analysis requests.
                
                Prior experiences, including roles at Base Titanium Limited and Geodev Kenya, have honed my skills in hardware and software support, troubleshooting, and system maintenance.
                
                As an ISO 9001:2005 Auditor, I conduct audits in alignment with international standards, contributing to a culture of excellence. Fluent in both English and Kiswahili, I possess effective communication skills to articulate technical concepts to diverse audiences.
                
                I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive positive change, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and experience to innovative projects.
